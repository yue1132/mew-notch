## Installation

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install --cask monuk7735/tap/mew-notch
```

### Manual Download

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/monuk7735/mew-notch/releases).
2. Move the app to the Applications folder.
3. Run the app and grant necessary permissions if prompted.


### ⚠️ "Damaged" or "Unidentified Developer" Error?

> I don't have an Apple Developer account yet, so the application will display a popup on the first launch.

**Option 1 (Recommended): Allow via System Settings**

1. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security**.
2. Scroll down to the **Security** section.
3. Look for "**MewNotch** was blocked..." and click **Open Anyway**.
4. Click **Open** in the confirmation popup.

**Option 2 (Advanced): Run this command in Terminal**

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/MewNotch.app
```

This command simply removes the "quarantine" flag that macOS places on apps downloaded from the internet, resolving the false error.

- `xattr` : The utility to modify file attributes.
- `-c` : Clears all attributes (removes the "quarantine" flag).
- `-r` : Recursive (applies to all files inside the app bundle).

## Usage


1. Launch **MewNotch**.
2. Re-launch to open settings, if required. Notch won't appear at first launch on non-notched devices.
3. Adjust the volume or brightness using Keyboard or Touch Bar.
4. Customise the settings to have notch on different or all monitors.
5. Enjoy the sleek visual feedback right on the notch!
